## UNET-IMAGE SEGMENTATION

Masking is the process that is underneath many types of 
- image processing 
- edge detection 
- motion detection  
- noise reduction 

### About UNET 
UNET is an convolutuional neural network which is a network whose architecture is capable of solving Image Segmentations Problems.\
Its Application includes 
- Classification alongwith Localization
- Sementic Segmentation
- Object Detection

### Real-World Applications

- Autonomous Vehicals
- Bio medical Image Diagnosis
- Geo-Sensing

In this project i have performed sementic segmentation on images of cats and Dogs.\

### Tooling
- Python 
- Numpy 
- Tensorflow
- Pillow
